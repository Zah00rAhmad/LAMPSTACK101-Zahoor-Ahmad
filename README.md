# LAMPSTACK101-Zahoor-Ahmad
This is my first project on GitHub
Introduction:
The LAMP stack is a popular open-source web development platform that consists of four main components: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (or sometimes Perl or Python). This documentation outlines the setup, configuration, and usage of the LAMP stack.

Step 0: Prerequisites 
EC2 Instance of t2.micro type and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (HVM) was lunched in the us-east-1 region using the AWS console

Step 1
The security group was configured with the following inbound rules:
Allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP) with source from anywhere on the internet.
Allow traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) with source from anywhere on the internet.
Allow traffic on port 22 (SSH) with source from any IP address. This is opened by default.

Step 2
Connect our instance using SSH, then cd into the folder where the private-key was downloaded then ssh into it
cd desktop
chmod 400 steghub.pem
ssh -i "steghub.pem" ubuntu@ec2-34-227-7-216.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Step 3 - Install Apache and Update the Firewall
Run apache2 package installation
Enable and verify that apache is running on as a service on the OS.
The server is running and can be accessed locally in the ubuntu shell by running the command below:
Test with the public IP address if the Apache HTTP server can respond to request from the internet using the url on a browser.

Step 4 - Install MySQL
Install a relational database (RDB)
Log in to mysql console

Step 5 - Install PHP
Install php Apache is installed to serve the content and MySQL is installed to store and manage data. PHP is the component of the set up that processes code to display dynamic content to the end user.

Step 6 - Create a virtual host for the website using Apache

Step 7 - Enable PHP on the website

Step 8 â€” Testing Database Connection
